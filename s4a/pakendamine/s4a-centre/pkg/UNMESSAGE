To completely deinstall the package you need to
remove the following files by performing the
following steps as root:

 rm -f ${PREFIX}/conf/httpd.conf
 rm -rf ${PREFIX}/conf/s4a
 rm -rf ${PREFIX}/conf/keygen
 rm -f ${PREFIX}/conf/haldusdigest
 rm -f ${PREFIX}/bin/s4ad
 rm -f ${PREFIX}/bin/rrdtool
 rm -f ${PREFIX}/bin/sh
 rm -rf ${PREFIX}/etc
 rm -rf ${PREFIX}/usr

Also clean root-user crontab, /etc/newsyslog.conf
and /etc/syslog.conf files from s4a properties.
