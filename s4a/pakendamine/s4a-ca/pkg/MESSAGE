To set up s4a-ca software completely you have to export
the S4A_CA_BIN environment variable executing the following
command:

	export S4A_CA_BIN=/usr/local/s4a-ca

It is reccomended to add the line above to the user's ~/.profile file.


After completing the tasks above your s4a ca should be up and
ready to serve s4a centralservers and intrusion detectors.
